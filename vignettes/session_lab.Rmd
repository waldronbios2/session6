**Learning objectives**

1. Calculate Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival probability over time
2. Plot survival curves for censored time-to-event data
3. Perform and interpret log-rank test
4. Define "informative" censoring

**Exercises**

1. Calculate the follow-up table for 6 MP patients in the leukemia study
2. Plot the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the follow-up table from 1. `library(survminer)` is recommendable. 
3. What is the 75th percentile of survival times for the 6 MP group? For the Placebo group? This is the time that 75% of the patients survive.
4. Suppose you were instructed to cap follow-up times at 20 weeks. Re-do the Kaplan-Meier plot for both groups, and re-do the logrank test.
5. Give a hypothetical example of how censoring in this example might be "informative."
